# FINAL-PROYECT-LC3---Mauro-Manuel-Rachael
Final Proyect: Manuel, Rachael, Mauro

This is a program that aims to display the lowest, the highest, and the average score of 5 different tests. The program will also match each grade with its letter equivalent (0 - 50 = F, 60 - 69 = D, 70 - 79 = C, 80 - 89 = B, 90 - 100 = A). My team hopes that this program can be useful for teachers, students, or anyone else who wants to calculate grades. This program performs calculations and converts numbers to letters based on 5 numbers (exam results) that the user will enter at the beginning of the program. The intention is to help people who need to get information about their exams such as their average, the letter obtained, etc. Using this program, it will be much easier to do the task mentioned above. 

Input: The user is prompted to input the test scores
Output: Display maximum, minimum, and average scores and letter grade equivalence on the console

Our program will run in an LC-3 simulator that users can obtain through Windows or a web page. For now, the entire program is designed to be used in LC3
The limitations are related to the number of grades you can work with and also limited in the things you can do (The user will only be able to calculate the minimum, maximum, and average and perform a number-to-letter conversion).

Regarding the interface, it is just a simple menu to give brief indications to the user of what to do, and the internet is not required for the program to work.
 
We expect the program to be able to process the grades and display the results effectively / The program should be responsive and accurate / The subroutines should function correctly so that they can do the proper calculations / We want our program to handle data input and output in the correct way
